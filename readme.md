## Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

According to World Health Organization statistics, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the world. CVDs were responsible for 32% of all global deaths in 2019, as estimated by the World Health Organization. Heart attacks and strokes were responsible for 85% of these deaths. Low- and middle-income countries account for more than three quarters of all CVD deaths.

We have created a web application and a prediction model based on machine learning using which a patient can fill in basic details like age, gender, Chest Pain Types, Cholesterol Level, etc. Based on these data, the model is able to predict heart disease. We have used various machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and KNN for prediction.User is also able to print the report for tracking the disease.
